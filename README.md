Chisel Unlimited is an extension to [Chisel Reborn](<https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/chisel-reborn>) which aims to add in new block variants [Stairs, Slabs, Levers etc.] for almost all vanilla blocks and on top of that several new chisel able versions of the blocks, with plans after initial release to dabble into mod compatibility and apply the same thing to other mods such as Biomes O' Plenty adjacent to how Unlimited Chisel Works worked for 1.12.2 however assets and such ideally aren't automated.

Block Variants and how they'll be sorted out;

Woods&Planks: Doors, Trapdoors, Pressure Plates, Buttons, Levers, Tool Stations, Fences, Fence Gates, Chests, Crafting Table, Signs, Hanging Signs, Ladders
Stones: Doors, Trapdoors, Pressure Plates, Buttons, Levers, Tool Stations, Walls, Furnace, Smelter, Smoker
All Blocks: Block Variants [Aiming for at least 10-20 each] and Base Block, Slabs, Stairs, Stone cutter compat

How chisel works; 

Make an item which is made from a stick and a peice of iron, that item on left click changes the state of the block looked at to the next variant in cycle and on right click opens a menu allowing one to put in a amount of a block to be changed into any of the shown variants.
